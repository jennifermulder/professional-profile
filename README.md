![](src/assets/images/portfolio.jpg)

## Purpose
To create a professional portfolio using React.js that will display my work samples as well as my experience with building single-page applications.

## Features
When the recruiter or viewer loads the site, they are presented with a header displaying my name and title, a navigation bar, the About me section, and a footer with my github and linkedIn links. The navigation bar includes the About me, the Portfolio of projects, Contact, and Resume links. When navigating to the portfolio section, there are several cards displaying my work with links to the GitHub pages as well as the deployed applications. When navigating to the Contact section, the user is presented with a form that requests information to email me directly. When navigating to the Resume section, the recruiter can see the details of my resume as well as a link allowing them to download a copy.
