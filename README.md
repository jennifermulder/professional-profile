![](public/images/portfolio.jpg)

## Purpose
To create a professional portfolio using React.js that will display my work samples as well as my experience wiht building single-page applications.

## Features
When the recruiter or viewer loads the site, they are presented with a header displaying my name and title, a navigation bar, the About me section, and a footer with my github and linkedIn links. The navigation bar includes the About me, the Portfolio of projects, Contact, and Resume links. When navigating to the portfolio section, there are several cards displaying my work with links to the GitHub pages as well as the deployed applications. When navigating to the Contact section, the user is presented with a form that requests information to email me directly. When navigating to the Resume section, the recruiter can see the details of my resume as well as a link allowing them to download a copy.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
